# GoblinRush
 Goblin Rush is a 2D score-based platform mobile game. In this game, we chase after a goblin who stole our horse-drawn carriage. The goblin throws wooden crates or bombs at us. We can render the bombs ineffective with a shield. If we use a sword to cut the wooden crates, they can contain either gold or health. Collecting gold in the game increases the score. Additionally, you earn points for the time spent without dying. January/2022
